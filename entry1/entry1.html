      <!-- Intro Text -->
      <p class="intro">
        Duality, in its essence, is not merely the existence of two opposing forces, but a deeper, more complex interplay between contrasting elements that shape the human experience. It reflects the psychological dualities within every individualâ€”the ongoing balance and tension between different aspects of the self, whether it be strength and vulnerability, light and shadow, or rationality and emotion.
      </p>

      <p class="intro">
        This website explores both visible and invisible dualities, examining how they manifest in the world around us and within ourselves, and offering a space for reflection on the tension and harmony between opposites.
