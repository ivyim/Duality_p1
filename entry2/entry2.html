        <!-- Intro Text -->
        <p class="intro">
            The world is built on opposing forces that define and shape our perception. Light gives meaning to darkness, sound emerges from silence, and movement contrasts with stillness. These visible dualities do not merely coexist; they interact, shaping our environment and influencing our emotions.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            Consider the cycle of day and night. The sun’s rise marks productivity, social interaction, and visibility, while night invites solitude, introspection, and rest. Without one, the other loses meaning—our experience of time is structured by this rhythmic opposition. Similarly, the built environment showcases stark dualities: open and closed spaces, natural landscapes and human-made structures. A doorway is neither purely open nor closed, but a threshold between two states.
        </p>
        <p class="intro">
            Yet, despite their contrast, these forces do not exist in absolute opposition. They blend, transition, and depend on each other. Twilight blurs day and night, an archway is both a passage and a boundary, and a whisper exists between silence and sound. The tangible divide is not rigid—it is a fluid negotiation between extremes that gives depth to our world.
